* Setup the package manager
Emacs has *many* features built-in, but we will want some third-party packages.
Here, "packages" just means additional code for Emacs.
You can generally think of them like plugins.

The =package-archives= variable specifies where to download packages from.

- MELPA = Widely used third-party package repository.
- ELPA = Emacs Lisp Package Archive. This is the official Emacs
  package archive.

#+begin_src elisp
  ;; Initialize package manager
  (require 'package)
  (setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
                           ("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))
  (package-initialize)
  (unless package-archive-contents
    (package-refresh-contents))
#+end_src

We will be using =use-package=, a tool for declaratively specifying
packages you want to use. Basically it makes it more convenient to
install and configure packages.

#+begin_src elisp
  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-install 'use-package))
  (require 'use-package)
  ;; Download and install configured packages if they aren't already installed.
  (setq use-package-always-ensure t)
#+end_src
