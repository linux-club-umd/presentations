# Licensing: How to open-source your work

Slides can be viewed in [HTML](./slides.html) or [PDF](./slides.pdf) format.

## Brief

Releasing your work as open-source is awesome, but it's not quite as simple as
uploading your code or importing a library. When using other people's code you
must follow their license, an agreement that specifies what your are allowed to
do with the code. In this workshop you'll learn about popular licenses, and how
to license your own code and non-code creations.
