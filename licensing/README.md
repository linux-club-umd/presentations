# Licensing: How to open-source your work

## Brief (2-4 sentences)

Open-source is convenient, but it's not quite as simple as uploading
your code or importing a library. When using other people's code you
must follow their license, an agreement that specifies what you are
allowed to do with the code. In this workshop you'll learn about
popular licenses, and how to license your own code and non-code
creations.

## Description

Detailed description should mention the following:
- permissive/copyleft licenses
- non-software licensing
- how to use and choose licenses for your projects and when working with the community
- a brief word about misconceptions on open source software (this is where proprietary/economic considerations come in)
basically a quick walkthrough of the topics

This workshop covers

FOSS stands for Free and Open Source Software.

The most popular FOSS licenses can be broken down into two categories:
permissive and copyleft. Permissive licenses allow others to do almost
anything they want. Copyleft FOSS licenses provide a similar level of
freedom, but require that modifications remain FOSS.

Some licenses are more appropriate for specific types of works. Much
of what Bitcamp attendees make will be code, but not all of it. We
discuss licenses for non-software works such as hardware designs, 3D
models, and art.

You will learn:

- How to add a license to your work, and hopefully get a good idea of
  which license you might want to use.
- What to consider when contributing within an established community.
- How to check the licenses of dependencies you want to use.
