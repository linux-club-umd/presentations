# Introduction
## Presenters
## What this presentation is

We intend that after this presentation you:

- Know what permissions popular licenses grant you
- Have a good idea of what licenses you may want to use for your
  projects
- (maybe) Have some understanding of the issues if you want to make
  money from open-source work

## What this presentation is **not**

We will avoid promoting a particular choice. However, we may mention
pros and cons of particular choices. Also, this presentation is
focused on free and open-source licenses.

We are not lawyers. We focus on well-understood truths, or point out
when something is not well-understood. We cite our sources. If you
want custom license terms or to use less well-understood licenses, you
should probably consult a lawyer.

# Terminology

## Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
<!-- TODO: Define proprietary as well, maybe put it here. -->
<!-- TODO: Maybe have something about the history here, if it doesn't take up too much time. -->

The free software movement and the open-source software movement are
separate.

Most licenses that fit the free software definition also fit the
open-source software definition, and vice versa. [@CategoriesOfFreeAndNonfreeSoftware]

## Copyright, works, licenses, oh my!

# Just stick it online, right?
# Permissive licenses
# Copyleft licenses

# Licenses for non-software works

Home 3D printing has made sharing 3D models common practice.

Similar to source code files, 3D model files can be considered creative works, and can be
licensed as such.

Note: This does not mean that the design or the physical prints are protected. Patents 
would be required for that.

# Working with others and in a community

## Making a new project
## Contributing to an existing project
## Dependencies and using other people's code

# Non-FOSS licenses

## Creative Commons

In recent years, the Creative Commons family of licenses have become popular.

3D printing repository websites such as Thingiverse and Printables have these licenses 
available for users to select from when uploading their designs.

While it is not well explained on these sites, the Non-Commercial versions of these licenses 
are not free or open source. [@CCLicensesOpen]
