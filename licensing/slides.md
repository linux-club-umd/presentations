# Introduction
## Presenters
## What this presentation is

We intend that after this presentation you:

- Know what permissions popular licenses grant you
- Have a good idea of what licenses you may want to use for your
  projects
- (maybe) Have some understanding of the issues if you want to make
  money from open-source work

## What this presentation is **not**

We will avoid promoting a particular choice. However, we may mention
pros and cons of particular choices. Also, this presentation is
focused on free and open-source licenses.

We are not lawyers. We focus on well-understood truths, or point out
when something is not well-understood. We cite our sources. If you
want custom license terms or to use less well-understood licenses, you
should probably consult a lawyer.

# Terminology

## Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
<!-- TODO: Define proprietary as well, maybe put it here. -->
<!-- TODO: Maybe have something about the history here, if it doesn't take up too much time. -->

The free software movement and the open-source software movement are
separate.

Most licenses that fit the free software definition also fit the
open-source software definition, and vice versa. [@CategoriesOfFreeAndNonfreeSoftware]
